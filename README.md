# project1
I have built the service with the facts similar to google docs. Basically I have tried to authenticate the user login process and then after access the doc, create the doc. For frontend design purpose I have used HTML,CSS,JavaScript and for backend I’m using php. Basic modules I have used:
1.	Login – User login is done based one valid username and password.
2.	Login_action- It will match the value of login php to the database. If the value is matched then the request will be granted.
3.	Error- When unauthenticated user is trying to access the page error will be shown.
4.	Logout- After the successful completion of task, if a user tries to leave the page, he can logout.
5.	Sign up- For creating a new account purpose , the user can signup with valid username and password.
6.	Imagesuploaded- For upload purpose of images in the document, I have attached sample image file.
This project having authenticating the user id, and the following up login details , accessing the documents , adding files, managing and monitering the documents.
